# How many apples do you have?

This project launches a website that displays how many apples are in my DB? That's a great question, although the real task in here is the use of containers.

> To execute the server:
> 1. Pull the repository from GitHub
> 2. Write in the console "./installion.sh"
> 3. Write again in the console "./run-it.sh

After downloading and installing all the dependencies, the web will show how many apples you have in the database.
And so that you can see that it works in any situation, you can change the "init-mongo.js" file, which contains the data for our database, and you can notice that the number of apples displayed on the site changes according to what is entered in the database.
